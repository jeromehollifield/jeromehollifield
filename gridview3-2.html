  <p>My name is Jerome Hollifield I’m a transfer student from Indianapolis, Indiana but I’ve recently moved to Dallas, Texas. I am current studying Software Development here at Champlain College. As a software development major, most of my research and writing happens when trying something new or having a thought surrounded by curiosity. Most of my life I was surrounded by technology, from when the computers and the Internet became developed to the evolution of music and portable devices. Throughout this course I want experience real world activities and exercises of modern technology. When I’m asked during an interview what my largest project was, I would like for it to be something relevant to present or future times as opposed to the past. A fun fact about me is I’ve never had the experience of owning a cat.   </p>
